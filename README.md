This Research Plan will be looking at the effectiveness and quality of HIV treatment and prevention in the country of Haiti. I wanted to look at a country with a developing Public Health Department with limited resources in comparision to the public health system of the United States. 

For a more unbiased analysis, I did not research any public health events that would have a possible impact on data. 

From this analysis, I can conclude that the "Universal ART" initiative implemented by the Ministry of Health in 2016 had the largest and strongest impact on HIV and AIDS prevention within the last decade. 

Some concerns that I have with this information was that many of the observed values were rough estimates, where the OBS_Value was something "<100". This is a very vague data. It makes analyis and data cleaning a challenge. 
I must consider that data collection may be more diffcult and challenging than in the US. Approximately, 40% of Haiti's population lives in rural areas which double that of the US population.In the US, we manage to have difficulties reach the rural populations so it may be even harder in Haiti.

For future projects, I would like to look at how the implementation of public health policies that prioritize universal access to healthcare improve public health outcomes for a geographical area. I would also like to explore the data collection process for public health information and see where there can be areas of improvement or higher efficiency, especially with the ongoing destabilization of Haiti's public health system. 

This information was made available to me by the UNICEF Data WareHouse: https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/hiv-aids-statistical-tables/
